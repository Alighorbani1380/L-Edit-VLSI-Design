# VLSI Design of Full Adder with Capacitor in L-Edit
## Overview
This repository contains the design and simulation of a Full Adder circuit using VLSI techniques in L-Edit. The design incorporates capacitors to enhance performance and efficiency. The project includes area calculations, simulation results, and layout images.

## Project Components
### 1. Area Calculation
The area of the Full Adder circuit is calculated as follows:

Area: 6966 MicronsÂ²
Minimum Bounding Box (MBB): 166 Microns x 56 Microns
Density: 74.9355%
The area calculation indicates the efficiency of the layout and helps in understanding the space utilization of the design.

### 2. Simulation Results
The circuit was simulated using Tanner T-Spice, and the following waveforms were obtained:

Input Voltages (A, B, C): The input signals are shown in the first three channels.
Output Voltage (Cout): The output voltage is displayed in the fourth channel.
Sum Voltage: The final sum output is shown in the last channel.
