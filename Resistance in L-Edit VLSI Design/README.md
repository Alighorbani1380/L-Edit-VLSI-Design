# Creating a Resistance in L-Edit VLSI Design
## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a resistance in L-Edit, a popular software tool used for VLSI design. The exercise will cover the design process, including layout creation and SPICE netlist extraction.
## Objectives
- Understand the process of designing a resistance in L-Edit.
- Learn how to extract SPICE netlists for simulation.
- Familiarize with the layout and parameters of the resistance.
## Materials
- L-Edit software
- Example layout images (provided below)
## Exercise Steps
### Create the Resistance Layout
Use the drawing tools to create the resistance layout as shown in the first image. Ensure to follow the dimensions indicated in the layout.

### Review the SPICE Netlist
Open the extracted SPICE netlist file to review the parameters and ensure they match your design. The netlist should include details such as:

- Resistance values
- Device count
-Number of nodes
## Conclusion
This exercise provides a foundational understanding of creating a resistance in L-Edit and extracting the corresponding SPICE netlist. By following the steps outlined, you will gain practical experience in VLSI design.
